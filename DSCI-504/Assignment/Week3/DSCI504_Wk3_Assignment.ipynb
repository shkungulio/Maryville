                "\n",
                "The self-join query is effective for identifying pairs of customers who live in the same city. By joining the **customers** table to itself on the \\`cus\\_city\\` field and excluding matches with identical customer IDs, it highlights customer pairs sharing the same location. This is useful for answering questions like, \"Which customers are from the same city?\" or \"What customer pairs exist by city?\"\n",
                "\n",
                "<span style=\"color: var(--vscode-foreground);\">However, this approach is not ideal for determining how many cities have more than one customer. The self-join generates multiple rows for each pair, which can lead to unnecessary complexity and potential overcounting. For instance, if three customers are from the same city, the query produces three pairings (A-B, A-C, B-C), complicating a straightforward count.</span>  \n",
                "\n",
                "<span style=\"color: var(--vscode-foreground);\">A more efficient method is to use a <b>GROUP BY</b> query with a <b>HAVING</b> clause. This groups customers by city, counts how many are in each group, and filters out cities with only one customer. The result is a cleaner, more accurate, and scalable way to identify cities with multiple customers.</span>  \n",
                "\n",
                "<span style=\"color: var(--vscode-foreground);\">In conclusion, while the self-join query is useful for analyzing relationships between customers in the same city, it is not well-suited for counting cities with more than one customer. For that purpose, aggregation using <b>GROUP BY</b>&nbsp;and <b>HAVING</b>&nbsp;provides a more effective solution.</span>  \n",
