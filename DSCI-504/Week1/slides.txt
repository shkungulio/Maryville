The Excel file contains a single sheet (`Sheet1`) with various student, course, and faculty-related data. It is currently in a denormalized (0NF) format with repeating groups and mixed entity information. We'll break it down and normalize it through 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

Here's how I will structure your PowerPoint presentation (7 slides total):

---

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**

* Course: \[Your Course Number]
* Course Name: \[Course Title]
* University Name: Maryville University
* Semester: Spring 2025
* Instructor: \[Instructor Name]
* Your Name: Seif Kungulio
* Date: May 9, 2025

---

### **Slide 2: Assignment Overview**

* **Goal**: Normalize a denormalized university data set through 3NF.
* **Outcome**: Identify key entities, remove redundancies, enforce primary and foreign keys, and define relationships to optimize the database for integrity and performance.

---

### **Slide 3: Proposed Normalization**

Major proposed tables (entities):

* `Students`
* `Courses`
* `Student_Enrollments`
* `Faculty`
* `Faculty_Assignments`
* `Terms`

---

### **Slide 4: 1NF**

Applied rules:

* Removed repeating groups (e.g., multiple classes, grades).
* Split composite columns (e.g., `StudentClasses`, `TermClassGrade`) into separate rows.
* Ensured each cell has atomic values.

Tables:

* `Students`: Basic student data (Name, Address, Gender, etc.)
* `Courses`: Each course offered (Course ID, Name)
* `Student_Enrollments`: One row per student-course-term combo
* `Terms`: Separate term details

---

### **Slide 5: 2NF**

Applied rules:

* Each table has a single-column primary key.
* Removed partial dependencies.

Updated Tables:

* `Students(StudentID)`
* `Courses(CourseID)`
* `Terms(TermID)`
* `Student_Enrollments(EnrollmentID)` referencing StudentID, CourseID, TermID

---

### **Slide 6: 3NF**

Applied rules:

* Removed transitive dependencies.
* Separated out non-key attributes that depend on other non-key attributes.

New or refined tables:

* `Faculty(FacultyID, Name, Status)`
* `Faculty_Assignments(FacultyID, CourseID, TermID)`
* `Ethnicity`, `Race`, and `Gender` could be reference tables if needed.

---

### **Slide 7: Relationships**

Created an Affiliations/ERD table linking:

* `Students → Student_Enrollments → Courses`
* `Courses ← Faculty_Assignments → Faculty`
* `Terms` is connected to both `Student_Enrollments` and `Faculty_Assignments`
