Subject: Informational Interview Request – Maryville Graduate Student

Dear Ms. Eapen,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Seif Kungulio, and I’m currently enrolled in the MS in Data Analytics program at Maryville University. I also serve as a Patient Care Technician on the CVIMU unit here at HCA Houston Healthcare – Clear Lake.

As part of a professional development initiative, I’m conducting informational interviews with experienced professionals in analytics and technical operations to gain deeper insights into career paths and the integration of data and infrastructure in healthcare settings.

I first learned about your leadership during new employee orientation, and your role overseeing operations at both Clear Lake and Mainland made a strong impression. Given my clinical background and growing interest in the strategic use of data within hospital systems, I would be truly grateful for the opportunity to learn from your experience.

Would you be open to a brief 20–30 minute conversation—either in person or virtually, depending on what’s most convenient for you—within the next couple of weeks?

Thank you for considering my request. I can be reached at [seif.kungulio@gmail.com](mailto:seif.kungulio@gmail.com) and will gladly coordinate around your availability.

Warm regards,
Seif Kungulio
Patient Care Technician – CVIMU
HCA Houston Healthcare – Clear Lake
