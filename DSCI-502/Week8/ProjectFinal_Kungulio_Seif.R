## 1. Load the dataset day.csv into memory.

# Set the working directory to the correct location for the dataset.
setwd("C:/PROJECTS/Maryville/DSCI-502/Week8")

# Load necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and reporting
library(dplyr)  # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2) # For visualization
library(knitr)  # For creating formatted tables

# Load the data from day.csv
Bikes.df <- read.csv("day.csv")

# Display the dimensions (rows and columns) of the dataframe
dim(Bikes.df) # Shows the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

# Display column names of the data frame
colnames(Bikes.df)

# Display the structure of the data frame
str(Bikes.df)



## 2. Perform the following data preparations using control structures:
##### a. Convert numerical season (1,2,3, 4) to characters (springer, summer, 
#####    fall and winter)

# Convert season to characters
Bikes.df$season <- factor(Bikes.df$season,
                          levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                          labels = c("spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"))

# Verify conversion of 'season' variable
str(Bikes.df$season)


##### b. Convert numerical weathersit (1,2,3,4) to characters (Good, Mist, Bad, 
#####    Severe)

# Convert weathersit to characters
Bikes.df$weathersit <- factor(Bikes.df$weathersit,
                              levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                              labels = c("Good", "Mist", "Bad", "Severe"))

# Verify conversion of 'weathersit' variable
str(Bikes.df$weathersit)



## 3. Consider the following predictors, season, holiday, workingday, 
##    weathersit, atemp, hum, windspeed, casual and List all categorical 
##    variables from this list and convert them to factors

# Convert categorical variables to factors
categorical_vars <- c("season", "holiday", "workingday", "weathersit")
Bikes.df[categorical_vars] <- lapply(Bikes.df[categorical_vars], as.factor)

# Display the statistical summary for factor variables
summary(Bikes.df[categorical_vars])

## 4. Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation and 
##    three quartiles (25th, 50th and 75th percentiles) of cnt.

# Summary Statistics for cnt
cnt_stats <- Bikes.df %>%
  summarise(minimum = min(cnt), maximum = max(cnt), mean = mean(cnt), 
            median = median(cnt), sd = sd(cnt), Q1 = quantile(cnt, 0.25), 
            Q2 = quantile(cnt, 0.5), Q3 = quantile(cnt, 0.75))

# Display summary statistics in a table
kable(cnt_stats)



## 5. Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation and 
##    three quartiles (25th, 50th and 75th percentiles) of registered.

# Summary Statistics for registered users
registered_stats <- Bikes.df %>%
  summarise(minimum = min(registered), maximum = max(registered), 
            mean = mean(registered), median = median(registered),
            sd = sd(registered), Q1 = quantile(registered, 0.25), 
            Q2 = quantile(registered, 0.5), Q3 = quantile(registered, 0.75))

# Display summary statistics in a table
kable(registered_stats)



## 6. Calculate the correlation coefficient of the two variables: registered 
##    and cnt. Do they have a strong relationship?

# Correlation between registered and cnt
correlation <- cor(Bikes.df$registered, Bikes.df$cnt)

# Print correlation result
print(correlation)



## 7. Calculate the frequency table of season? Whatâ€™s the mode of 
##    season variable?

# Frequency table of 'season' and identify the most common season
season_freq <- table(Bikes.df$season)
print(season_freq)
mode_season <- names(which.max(season_freq))
print(paste("Mode of season: ", mode_season))



## 8. Calculate the cross table of season and weathersit, then produce 
##    proportions by rows and columns respectively.

# Create a cross table between 'season' and 'weathersit' and compute proportions
season_weather_table <- table(Bikes.df$season, Bikes.df$weathersit)
season_weather_row_prop <- prop.table(season_weather_table, 1)
season_weather_col_prop <- prop.table(season_weather_table, 2)
kable(season_weather_table)
kable(season_weather_row_prop)
kable(season_weather_col_prop)



## 9. Please plot the histogram and density of the cnt and add the vertical 
##    line denoting the mean using ggplot2.

# Plot histogram and density of 'cnt' with mean line
ggplot(Bikes.df, aes(x = cnt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500, fill = "green") +
  geom_density(color = "red", lwd = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(cnt)), 
             color = "black", linetype = "dashed", lwd = 1) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of cnt") + theme_test()



## 10. Please scatter plot of cnt (y-axis) against registered (x-axis) and add 
##     the trend line using ggplot2.

# Scatter plot of 'cnt' vs 'registered' with trend line
ggplot(Bikes.df, aes(x = registered, y = cnt)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
  theme_test() +
  ggtitle("Scatter plot of cnt vs registered")



## 11. Please plot the barplot of season and weathersit on the same barplot 
##     using ggplot2

# Barplot of season and weathersit
ggplot(Bikes.df, aes(x = season, fill = weathersit)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#008000", "#0000FF", "#FF0000")) +
  ggtitle("Barplot of season and weathersit") + theme_test()



## 12. Please boxplot cnt (y-axis) against weathersit (x-axis) and save the 
##     graph in a file, cntweather.jpg, using ggplot2. Are there any differences
##     in cnt with respect to weathersit?

# Box plot of 'cnt' vs 'weathersit', saved as 'cntweather.jpg'
cnt_weather_boxplot <- ggplot(Bikes.df, 
                              aes(x = weathersit, 
                                  y = cnt, 
                                  fill = weathersit)) +

######    predictors are: season, weathersit, atemp, and registered. 
######    Write down the math formula with numerical coefficients for 
######    predictors atemp and registered and skip the coefficients 
######    for season and weathersit.
